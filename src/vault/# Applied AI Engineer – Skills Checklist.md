---

# 2. Phase Plan

## Phase 1 (0–2 Months)

- Finish V8 internals
- Python for DSA (1–2/day)
- Begin SageMaker project
- Improve performance contributions at job

## Phase 2 (2–4 Months)

- Learn React Internals
- Strengthen AI project
- Build JS devtool
- Polish knowledge for team discussions / promotion

## Phase 3 (4–6 Months)

- Intensive interview prep
- Polish AI project + DevTool
- Resume optimization
- Mock interviews (Python + System Design + AI)

---

# 3. Portfolio Targets

## Must-Have Deliverables

- SageMaker AI project
- V8-based DevTool dashboard
- 150–250 LeetCode Python solutions
- React Internals deep dives (blogs or notes)
- V8 Internals documentation
- Resume with quantifiable achievements

---

# 4. High-Level Goal

To become a hybrid of:

- **AI Engineer**
- **Systems/Performance Engineer**
- **Full-Stack Engineer**
and stand out in top-tier interviews.

This roadmap guarantees growth toward 30+ LPA opportunities at Amazon and similar companies.

# Daily, Weekly, Monthly Study Schedule

This schedule is optimized for someone working full-time in a fast-paced startup while preparing for high-package AI + Systems roles.

---

# 1. Daily Schedule (Mon–Fri)

## Morning (30–45 min)

- Solve 1–2 LeetCode problems in Python
- Convert JS → Python for reinforcement

## Work Hours

- 100% focus on current SDE job
- Document optimizations or lessons

## Evening (30–45 min)

Study one of the following depending on phase:

- V8 internals
- React internals
- Python ML fundamentals

## Night (Optional)

- Review notes
- Micro-learning: watch 10–20 minute deep dive videos

---

# 2. Weekend Schedule

## Weekend A — Python/SageMaker AI Project

Tasks:

- Train model
- Deploy endpoint
- Add frontend or API integration
- Refactor code
- Write documentation

## Weekend B — JS DevTool (V8 Analytics)

Tasks:

- Build performance dashboard
- Add profiling tools
- Visualize hidden classes, GC behavior, etc.

---

# 3. Monthly Schedule

## Month-End Checklist

- At least 25–40 LeetCode problems completed
- Visible progress on both projects
- 4–6 sessions studying internals (V8 / React)
- Update GitHub activity
- Capture 2–3 achievements from job

---

# 4. Quarterly Milestones

## Every 3 Months

- Polish 1 project for portfolio
- Resume review
- Update Case Studies (job impact)
- Evaluate interview readiness (mock interviews)

---

# 5. Key Principle

**Consistency > Intensity**

Small daily progress compounds into career-changing results.

# High-Impact Side Projects

These two projects build your credibility as:

- an AI engineer,
- a systems engineer,
- and a full-stack problem solver.

---

# Project 1 — SageMaker AI Project (Python)

## Purpose

Demonstrate cloud ML skills for Amazon Applied AI roles.

## Possible Project Ideas

1. Predictive analytics dashboard  
2. NLP sentiment classifier  
3. Automatic text summarizer  
4. Anomaly detection on time-series data  
5. LLM-powered endpoint with custom preprocessing

## Architecture Outline

1. Data preprocessing in Python
2. Train model in SageMaker Notebook / Training Job
3. Deploy model as an endpoint
4. Create API Gateway or simple web UI
5. Visualize predictions
6. Write clear README + diagrams

## Milestones

**Week 1–2** → Setup + training  
**Week 3–4** → Deployment + endpoints  
**Week 5** → UI + integration  
**Week 6** → Documentation + hosting  

---

# Project 2 — V8 Internals DevTool ( JavaScript )

## Purpose

Build a rare, systems-level JS tool to stand out.

## Project Ideas

1. JS performance profiler  
2. Memory + GC visualization tool  
3. Hidden class inspector  
4. Inline caching visual debugger  
5. Bytecode execution visualizer  

## Architecture Outline

- Node.js backend to analyze JS code
- Chrome DevTools Protocol or Inspector integration
- Frontend dashboard with:
  - performance metrics
  - GC cycles
  - memory usage
  - IC states
  - hidden class transitions

## Milestones

**Week 1–2** → Architecture + backend  
**Week 3–4** → Frontend & analytic visualizations  
**Week 5** → Integration + polish  
**Week 6** → Deployment + README  

---

# Final Goal: Resume-Ready Portfolio

Your portfolio should include:

- Deployed SageMaker project
- Deployed V8 DevTool
- Clean documentation
- Before/after screenshots
- A writing section explaining:
  - What you built  
  - Why it’s useful  
  - What you learned  
  - How this ties to Amazon roles

With these two projects + consistent LC + internals knowledge, your profile becomes top-tier.
