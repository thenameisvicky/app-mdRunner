## Introduction

- Learning **how to think** is one of the most important skills you can develop.  
- Yeah documenting this may seem stupid but deep dive into **How to think?** made me prepare a mini note with my understanding about Thinking.
- Thinking clearly allows you to **solve problems, design systems, make decisions, and create strategies** effectively like an elite.  

## Principles of Thinking

1. **Understand before acting** – clarify the problem, define goals, and gather constraint (Limitations).  
2. **Break it down** – divide complex problems into manageable parts.  
3. **Think in layers and abstractions** – from high-level concepts to implementation details.  
4. **Challenge assumptions** – never assume always prove even if it is theory make it out with proof like a scientist take responsiblity and dig eveything out that is how i move and the people i inspire moved.  
5. **Iterate and reflect** – refine your approach after testing and reflection.  

## Problem Solving

- **Steps to solve any problem:**
  1. Understand the problem fully.
  2. Identify inputs, outputs, constraints, and edge cases.
  3. Break the problem into smaller components.
  4. Recognize patterns or standard approaches (e.g., sliding window, two pointers).
  5. Create a rough solution.
  6. Walk through examples mentally or even write down every iteration or log every iteration to understand how the program working.
  7. Optimize and refine.

- **Tips for mental simulation:**
  - Track only essential variables, the variables which change over iterations or conditions.
  - Practice small examples in your head or write it down never hesitate hesitation is defeat.
  - Visualize arrays, sums, or sequences mentally.

## Designing Systems

- **Start high-level**: identify core components and responsibilities.  
- **Think in layers**: e.g., UI → Service → Database → Storage.  
- **Consider edge cases and failures**: how can things break?, map the paths to failure and dodge them! - Inversion thinking.  
- **Iterate**: start simple, improve with feedback.  
- **Use diagrams**: boxes, arrows, flowcharts, even mentally.

## Approaching New Problems

- Start from the **goal** and work backward if needed.  
- List **possible approaches** without judgment.  
- Evaluate **trade-offs**: complexity, time, memory, maintainability.  
- Pick an approach and **test it** quickly.  
- Refine based on results and feedback.
- Quickly prepare a working prototype test it over time refine it -- Agile framework.

## Learning from Others

- **Understand fully**: explain the approach in your own words after fully listening.  
- **Identify assumptions**: what conditions must hold?  
- **Visualize**: simulate it on examples.  
- **Think of alternatives**: could it be solved differently?  
- **Critique**: strengths, weaknesses, edge cases.

## Mental Models

- **First Principles Thinking** – break problems into fundamental truths, dig deep into internals don't just use stuff learn how it works.  
- **Inversion** – think about what you want to avoid, how the system fails.  
- **Occam’s Razor** – simplest solutions are often better, real engineering is solving complex problem with simplicity.  
- **Second-Order Thinking** – consider consequences of decisions, and fallback plans.  
- **Probabilistic Thinking** – weigh options based on the use case you are solving.  
- **Opportunity Cost** – what are you giving up by choosing and is it fair?

## Practice Exercises

1. Solve small coding problems **mentally** for 30–50 minutes or days or months until you master and really understand it fully.  
2. Take one real-world system (e.g., a website) and design its architecture on paper.  
3. For every solution you read, ask:
   - Can it be simplified?
   - What assumptions does it make?
   - What alternative approaches exist?
4. Reflect daily on decisions: what worked, what failed, what can improve.
