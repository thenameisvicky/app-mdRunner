# 🧠 AI Engineer Roadmap (Amazon / 20+ LPA Target)

**Goal:** Prepare for AI Engineer roles at Amazon or equivalent Tier-1 companies with a solid 20+ LPA package.  
**Profile Baseline:** MERN Stack + DevOps background + interest in AI/ML.

---

## 1️⃣ What Is an AI Engineer?

An **AI Engineer** bridges **software engineering** and **machine learning**.  
They design, build, and deploy AI-powered systems—integrating models, pipelines, and APIs into scalable products.

| Type | Focus | Example |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Applied / Platform AI Engineer** | Use & deploy pretrained models | Alexa, Amazon Ads, Bedrock |
| **ML / Research Engineer** | Train & optimize models, build data pipelines | AWS SageMaker, large-scale training |

You’ll target **Applied AI Engineer** roles first—best mix of skill & payoff.

- Start light reading: "Hands-On ML with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow"

- **Weekly Routine**

- 🕐 Workdays: 1 hr DSA + 30 min math/ML reading  
- 🕐 Weekends: 3 hr coding project or math deep dive

---

### 🗓️ Months 3–4: Core ML

- **Goals**

- Learn supervised & unsupervised learning
- Implement models: Linear/Logistic regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Build **Project #1 (Classical ML)**  
- Continue DSA (DP + Graph focus)

---

### 🗓️ Month 5: Deep Learning & NLP

- **Goals**

- Learn PyTorch fundamentals: tensors, training loops
- Study CNN, RNN, Transformer basics
- Build **Project #2 (NLP or Speech)** using Hugging Face or Whisper
- Review 30 LeetCode mixed problems

---

### 🗓️ Month 6: MLOps + Interview Prep

- **Goals**

- Containerize model → Deploy on AWS (ECS/Lambda)
- Integrate CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Build **Project #3 (MLOps)**  
- Review behavioral & system design questions  
- Mock interviews (Pramp, Interviewing.io)

---

## 5️⃣ Interview Prep Focus

| Round | Focus Area | How to Prepare |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| 1–2 | DSA + Problem Solving | LeetCode, mock contests |
| 3 | ML System / Pipeline Design | Design data & model flow diagrams |
| 4 | Behavioral (Leadership Principles) | STAR method answers |
| Optional | Case Study | Improve an ML product; talk trade-offs |

---

## 6️⃣ Mindset & Routine

- 🧘‍♂️ **Consistency > Intensity** – small daily progress compounds.  
- 💬 **Document learning** – share projects, write short posts on LinkedIn.  
- 🔄 **Iterate** – after 3 months, reassess weak areas.  
- 🛠️ **Portfolio = proof** – recruiters value public work more than certificates.  

---

## 📚 Suggested Resources

- *Hands-On Machine Learning* – Aurélien Géron  
- *Deep Learning with PyTorch* – Eli Stevens  
- *System Design Primer* (GitHub)  
- *Mathematics for ML* (free PDF)
