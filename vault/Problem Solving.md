1. Unique travel path with time **Description** - _You are given a list of logs where each entry is `[ personId , locationId , timestamp ]` . A Person can travel to a location only if They have not been there in past `T` minutes. No other person was in that location at exact same time. Write a function that returns total number of valid trips._
2. Compressed Mirror Array **Description** - _You're given an array of integers. You must return `true` if the array can be compressed into a mirrored structure after removing at most one element. A mirrored structure - `[ 1, 2, 3, 2, 1 ]`._
3. Weird Subarray Sum Puzzle ****Description** - _Given an array of integers, find the longest subarray where , Sum of subarray is divisible by the number of `distinct elements` in the subarray._
4. Binary String Merge Game **Description** - _You're given two binary strings `A` and `B`. You can merge them by choosing characters one at a time from either `A` or `B`, keeping the order from each string. Your task is to return the maximum number of 1s in the final string, such that no more than 2 consecutive 1s appear._
5. Longest Balanced Word **Description** - _Given a string containing only lowercase English letters, find the longest substring where For every character, the number of vowels equals consonants. At least 2 different vowels must appear._

 Design a food rating system that can do the following:
    - **Modify** the rating of a food item listed in the system.
    - Return the highest-rated food item for a type of cuisine in the system.
    - Implement the `FoodRatings` class:
     - `FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings)` Initializes the system. The food items are described by `foods`, `cuisines` and `ratings`, all of which have a length of `n`.
        - `foods[i]` is the name of the `ith` food,
        - `cuisines[i]` is the type of cuisine of the `ith` food, and
        - `ratings[i]` is the initial rating of the `ith` food.
    - `void changeRating(String food, int newRating)` Changes the rating of the food item with the name `food`.
    - `String highestRated(String cuisine)` Returns the name of the food item that has the highest rating for the given type of `cuisine`. If there is a tie, return the item with the **lexicographically smaller** name.
    - _Note that a string `x` is lexicographically smaller than string `y` if `x` comes before `y` in dictionary order, that is, either `x` is a prefix of `y`, or if `i` is the first position such that `x[i] != y[i]`, then `x[i]` comes before `y[i]` in alphabetic order._
